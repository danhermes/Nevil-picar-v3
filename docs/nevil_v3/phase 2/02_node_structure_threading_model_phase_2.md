# Nevil v3.0 Node Structure and Threading Model - Phase 2 Features

## Overview

This document contains the Phase 2 advanced features for the Nevil v3.0 node structure and threading model, including performance optimizations, advanced error recovery patterns, and stress testing capabilities.

## 5. Performance Considerations - Phase 2

### 5.1 Memory Management - Phase 2
- Use weak references for callback storage
- Implement message queue size limits
- Regular garbage collection for long-running nodes
- Memory-mapped files for large data sharing

### 5.2 CPU Optimization - Phase 2
- Thread affinity for critical nodes
- Priority-based thread scheduling
- Efficient serialization for message passing
- Lazy initialization of expensive resources

### 5.3 I/O Optimization - Phase 2 (Enhanced)
- Asynchronous file operations for logging
- Buffered message delivery
- Connection pooling for network resources
- Efficient audio buffer management

## 6. Error Recovery Patterns - Phase 2

### 6.1 Circuit Breaker - Phase 2
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """Prevents cascading failures"""
    
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold: int = 5, timeout: float = 60.0):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = 0
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        with self._lock:
            if self.state == "OPEN":
                if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                    self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
                else:
                    raise RuntimeError("Circuit breaker is OPEN")
            
            try:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                if self.state == "HALF_OPEN":
                    self.state = "CLOSED"
                    self.failure_count = 0
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                self.failure_count += 1
                self.last_failure_time = time.time()
                
                if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                    self.state = "OPEN"
                
                raise e
```

## 7. Testing Strategy - Phase 2

### 7.3 Stress Tests - Phase 2 (Future - not 1, 2)
- High message volume scenarios
- Resource exhaustion testing
- Long-running stability tests
- Memory leak detection

## Conclusion

The Phase 2 enhancements to the Nevil v3.0 node structure and threading model provide advanced capabilities for production deployments while maintaining the core simplicity and reliability of the base framework.
