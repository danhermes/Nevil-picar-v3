Autonomous Mode for Nevil v3.0

GPT-driven autonomous behavior system where AI controls ALL movement and speech
decisions based on mood profiles. No hardcoded behaviors - pure AI autonomy.

## Key Features

### 100% GPT-Driven Decision Making
- No hardcoded movement sequences or vocalizations
- GPT chooses all actions based on mood guidelines in system prompt
- Silence and inactivity are valid responses
- Each autonomous cycle is unique and environment-responsive

### Mood System (8 Moods)
- playful, brooding, curious, melancholic, zippy, lonely, mischievous, sleepy
- Each mood has distinct personality traits (energy, curiosity, sociability, whimsy)
- Moods persist 15-30 cycles for stability (reduced from constant changes)
- Only 30% chance to change when threshold reached
- Speech frequency varies by mood (15%-65%)

### Vision Integration
- High vision usage: 70% when Nevil will speak, 35% when silent
- Enables environment-responsive behavior even during quiet periods
- GPT sees and reacts to surroundings in autonomous mode

### Listening Windows (5-20 seconds)
- Mood-based duration: zippy moods = ~6s (impatient), lonely moods = ~17s (patient)
- Formula: Higher sociability + lower energy = longer listening window
- Provides interruption opportunity between autonomous cycles
- User can say "stop auto" or "come back" to exit
- User can say "set mood [name]" to change personality

### Gesture Speed System
- All 120+ gestures support :slow, :med, :fast speed modifiers
- Speed affects pause durations (slow=2x, med=1x, fast=0.5x)
- GPT chooses speeds to match mood (zippy=fast, melancholic=slow)
- Creates expressive choreography with rhythmic variation

### Microphone Mutex
- Speech synthesis and navigation can run in parallel
- Speech recognition blocks during both TTS and navigation
- Prevents Nevil from hearing himself or servo noise
- 0.5s delay before navigation starts for better speech sync

### Activity Periods
- Inactive: [] empty actions or pause gestures
- Slight movement: 1-3 gestures
- Active: 5-12 gestures with variety
- GPT decides based on mood energy level

    """
    GPT-driven autonomous behavior system.

    Architecture:
    - No hardcoded movement sequences or vocalizations
    - 100% GPT decides what to do based on mood guidelines in system prompt
    - Moods change infrequently (every 15-30 cycles, 30% chance when threshold reached)
    - Vision usage varies by activity (70% when speaking, 35% when silent)
    - Speech frequency matches mood personality (15%-65% depending on mood)
    - Listening windows are mood-based (5.8s for zippy to 16.7s for lonely)
    - Supports 3-speed gesture system (:slow, :med, :fast) for expressive movement
    - Uses microphone mutex to prevent self-talk while allowing parallel speech/movement

    Cycle Flow:
    1. Check if mood change threshold reached ‚Üí maybe_change_mood()
    2. Determine vision usage based on mood speech frequency
    3. Generate autonomous prompt referencing mood behavioral guidelines
    4. Call GPT with prompt and optional vision
    5. Execute GPT's chosen actions (if any) with speed modifiers
    6. Speak GPT's message (if any) in parallel with movements
    7. Increment cycle counter
    8. Mood-based listening window (5-20s) for user interruption
    9. Loop back to step 1 (unless auto_enabled = False)
